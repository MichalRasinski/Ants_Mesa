# Ants_Mesa

So far:

Ants:
- die if health is zero
- some percent stays at the colony
- when foraging go more or less in one direction
- if are next to an enemy ant, then they attack
- if are next to a food site, then they pick food and go to the home colony based on their smell
- if they carry food and are next to the home colony then they leave it there

Colonies:
- spawn ants 
- shelter ants
- stores food

FoodSites:
- store food
- regenerate food if they are renewable

# TODO
- ants carring food leaves feromone trail
