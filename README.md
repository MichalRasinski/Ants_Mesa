# Ants_Mesa

Ants:
- die if health or energy is zero
- if they are inside the colony and energy is below 80 then they eat (energy=100)
- normally they stay at the colony unless there is 'food trail' pheromone nearby. Then they follow that pheromone trail.
- if they loose the trail, they try to go back to the anthill based on 'self' pheromone
- once in a while a foraging party goes out looking for food. Each ant goes more or less straight not following any trail.
- if are next to an enemy ant, then they attack
- if are next to a food site, then they pick food and go to the home colony based on the 'self' pheromone.
- if they carry food they leave 'food trail' pheromone, which strength is based on the abundance of the food site.
- if they carry food and are next to the home colony then they leave it there

Queens:
- goes more or less in one direction
- if they find an abundant food site then they start a new colony on the top of that  

Anthills:
- spawn ants with some probability based on food supplies and reproduction rate 
- spawns queens once in a while. More often with higher reproduction rate.
- gives shelter to ants
- stores food
- releases ants if they smell 'food trail'
- releases foraging ants periodically

FoodSites:
- store food
- regenerate food if they are renewable
